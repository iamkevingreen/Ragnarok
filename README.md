* [Neat for a grid system](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
* [SASS support via meteor-scss (meteor package)](https://github.com/fourseven/meteor-scss)
* [bower support via mquandalle (meteor package)](https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-bower)
* [s3 upload support via lepozep (meteor package)](https://github.com/Lepozepo/S3/)
* [Meteor Accounts-UI and Accounts-Password](https://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/accounts)

*please check packages above if any issues arrive*

## Dummy Meteor App

This is a dummy app that will help you start with meteor-sass-bower

I found a lot of the support out there for doing this kind of confusing or unable. So hopefully using this as a starter will put you in a good place.

## Other

This is a simple app with mongo, it shows a list of posts, has user account functionality and the ability to CRUD items
